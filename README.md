# DND-5E-SPELL-TRACKER
A simple spell slot tracker for D&amp;D 5th Edition. 
This file is intended simply as a small personal method of keeping track of spells in D&D 5th Edition. Utilising a 2D array, the tracker allows registration of a quantity of spell slots per spell level, which allows the user to tailor their usage to any class and level that they wish. To reduce irritating inputs, the program utilises a recursive function that reduces each function call to a simple integer input.

Entering '1' will call the register spell function. This is where you designate a number of spell slots per spell level. 
Entering '2' will cast a spell of a level of your choosing.
Entering '3' will restore the spell slots to their maximum capacity, as if a long rest had been completed in-game.

The project is likely abound with optimisation issues, however this was only intended as a personal tool. Any improvements are welcome.

Enjoy.
